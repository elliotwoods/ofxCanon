## Requirements

* openFrameworks 0.9.0 or later
* You must download the EDSDK from Canon ([Canon Europe EDSDK download](http://www.didp.canon-europa.com), [Canon USA EDSDK download](http://consumer.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/digital_rebel_xt?fileURL=ps_sdk_form&pageKeyCode=downloadLicense&id=0901e02480057a74_1&productOverviewCid=0901e0248003ce28&keycode=Sdk_Lic)).

With Visual Studio you can optionally use the [ofxAddonLib](http://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxAddonLib] pattern. Please refer to the ofxAddonLib [Readme.md](https://github.com/elliotwoods/ofxAddonLib/blob/master/Readme.md) for notes on how to get this setup.

## ofxEdsdk compatability 

This addon carries on from [ofxEdsdk](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxEdsdk) adding some features (although some may be missing).

Compatability with ofxEdsdk is provided by the `ofxCanon::Simple` class which has the same interface as `ofxEdsdk::Camera` (i.e. all the method names are the same and it should act as a drop-in replacement if you need it).

Some users of ofxEdsdk (myself included) have experienced issues with ofxEdsdk, and this addon is intended as a way to circumvent those issues. If ofxEdsdk works well for you, then I'd suggest you stick with it.
